# The Epic Duel: Maximizing Damage Against the Immortal Boss 🗡️🐉

## The Legendary Battle of Two Against Infinity

Welcome, brave strategists, to the Realm of Eternal Combat! 🏰✨ We face a dire situation: an immortal boss threatens our land, and we must select our mightiest warriors for an epic last stand. Though victory is impossible, we aim to leave a mark on this indestructible foe that will echo through the ages.

As the newly appointed Grandmaster of Battle Tactics, your task is to devise a strategy (ahem, algorithm) to determine the maximum damage our heroes can inflict before their inevitable defeat. The fate of our legend hangs in the balance!

## The Rules of Engagement 📜

Before we dive into battle plans, let's understand the cosmic rules that govern this clash:

1. We have N warriors, each with their own Health (H) and Damage-per-second (D) stats.
2. The immortal boss has unlimited health and deals B damage per second.
3. We must choose exactly two warriors for battle: a frontliner and a supporter.
4. The boss attacks the frontliner until they fall, then moves to the supporter.
5. Both chosen warriors deal damage as long as they're standing.
6. Damage is dealt continuously - even fractions of a second count!

## The Novice Tactician's Approach: The Brute Force Bash 🐣

As a beginner strategist, you might be tempted to simulate every possible warrior combination. This approach, while straightforward, examines all possibilities:

```python
def max_damage_novice(N, H, D, B):
    max_damage = 0
    for i, (health, damage) in enumerate(zip(H, D)):
        survival_time = float(health / B)
        warrior_damage = damage * survival_time
        for j in range(i + 1, N):
            partner_survival_time = float(H[j] / B)
            partner_damage = D[j] * partner_survival_time
            warrior_as_frontline_damage = partner_damage + (D[i] * partner_survival_time) + warrior_damage
            partner_as_frontline_damage = warrior_damage + (D[j] * survival_time) + partner_damage
            max_damage = max(max_damage, warrior_as_frontline_damage, partner_as_frontline_damage)
            
    return max_damage
```

Let's break down this brute force approach:

1. 🔄 We iterate through all possible pairs of warriors (i and j).
2. ⏱️ For each warrior, we calculate their survival time (health / boss damage).
3. 💥 We compute the damage each warrior would deal as both frontline and support.
4. 📊 We keep track of the maximum damage dealt across all combinations.

Key aspects of this implementation:

- `max_damage`: Tracks the highest damage achieved across all warrior combinations.
- `survival_time` and `partner_survival_time`: How long each warrior can last against the boss.
- `warrior_damage` and `partner_damage`: The damage each warrior deals during their survival time.
- `warrior_as_frontline_damage`: Total damage when the current warrior is in front.
- `partner_as_frontline_damage`: Total damage when the partner warrior is in front.

While this works and is easy to understand, it's like sending scouts to simulate every possible duel. It gets the job done but takes far too long for a large number of warriors. The time complexity is O(N²), which becomes inefficient for large N. We need a more clever strategy! ⏳

## The Tempting Trap: The Greedy General 🕸️

As you gain more experience, you might be tempted by a seemingly clever solution: always put the warrior with the highest damage-to-health ratio in front. But beware! This greedy approach might miss the optimal combination. It's like always sending your strongest warrior first without considering the synergies of different pairings. 🚫


```python
def greedy_max_damage(N, H, D, B):
    # Calculate damage-to-health ratio for each warrior
    ratios = [(d / h, i) for i, (h, d) in enumerate(zip(H, D))]
    # Sort warriors by their damage-to-health ratio in descending order
    sorted_warriors = sorted(ratios, reverse=True)
    
    max_damage = 0
    best_frontline = -1
    best_support = -1
    
    # Try the top warrior as frontline
    frontline = sorted_warriors[0][1]
    frontline_survival_time = H[frontline] / B
    frontline_damage = D[frontline] * frontline_survival_time
    
    # Find the best support (excluding the frontline warrior)
    for _, i in sorted_warriors[1:]:
        support_survival_time = H[i] / B
        support_damage = D[i] * (frontline_survival_time + support_survival_time)
        total_damage = frontline_damage + support_damage
        
        if total_damage > max_damage:
            max_damage = total_damage
            best_frontline = frontline
            best_support = i
    
    return max_damage, best_frontline, best_support

# Test our greedy battle strategy
N = 5
H = [10, 20, 15, 25, 30]  # Health of warriors
D = [5, 7, 6, 8, 10]  # Damage per second of warriors
B = 2  # Boss damage per second

greedy_damage, greedy_frontline, greedy_support = greedy_max_damage(N, H, D, B)
print(f"Greedy Maximum Damage: {greedy_damage}")
print(f"Greedy Frontline Warrior: {greedy_frontline + 1}")
print(f"Greedy Support Warrior: {greedy_support + 1}")
```

This greedy approach seems logical at first glance. It:
1. Calculates the damage-to-health ratio for each warrior.
2. Selects the warrior with the highest ratio as the frontline.
3. Pairs them with the support warrior that maximizes total damage.

However, beware! This strategy, while often effective, can miss the optimal combination in certain scenarios. It's like always sending your seemingly strongest warrior first without considering the synergies of different pairings. 🚫

For example, consider a scenario where we have three warriors:
- Warrior A: Health = 10, Damage = 20
- Warrior B: Health = 20, Damage = 15
- Warrior C: Health = 30, Damage = 10

The greedy approach would always choose Warrior A as the frontline due to their high damage-to-health ratio. However, in some cases, using Warrior B or C as the frontline might allow for more total damage to be dealt before both warriors fall.



## The Ultimate Battle Plan: Divide and Conquer 🗡️

Now, let's unveil the true strategy of legendary tacticians. The key insight is this: we can precompute the best supporter for each potential frontliner, then find the best overall combination.

Behold, the Ultimate Battle Plan:

```python
def max_damage_optimal(N, H, D, B):
    # Step 1: Precompute the best supporter for each warrior
    best_support = [0] * N
    max_support_damage = [0] * N
    for i in range(N):
        time_i = H[i] / B
        for j in range(N):
            if j != i:
                support_damage = D[j] * (time_i + H[j] / B)
                if support_damage > max_support_damage[i]:
                    max_support_damage[i] = support_damage
                    best_support[i] = j

    # Step 2: Find the best frontliner and their precomputed best supporter
    max_damage = 0
    best_frontline = -1
    for i in range(N):
        time_i = H[i] / B
        total_damage = D[i] * time_i + max_support_damage[i]
        if total_damage > max_damage:
            max_damage = total_damage
            best_frontline = i

    return max_damage, best_frontline, best_support[best_frontline]

# Test our legendary battle strategy
N = 5
H = [10, 20, 15, 25, 30]  # Health of warriors
D = [5, 7, 6, 8, 10]  # Damage per second of warriors
B = 2  # Boss damage per second

max_damage, frontline, support = max_damage_optimal(N, H, D, B)
print(f"Maximum Damage: {max_damage}")
print(f"Frontline Warrior: {frontline + 1}")
print(f"Support Warrior: {support + 1}")
```

## Unraveling the Battle Tactics 🧵

Let's break down our Ultimate Battle Plan:

1. 🛡️ Supporter Optimization: We precompute the best supporter for each potential frontliner.
2. ⚔️ Frontline Selection: We then find the best frontliner by considering their damage plus their precomputed best supporter's damage.
3. 🚀 Efficiency: We make just two passes through our warriors, drastically reducing computation time.

## The Wisdom of the Battle Grandmaster 🧠

This solution teaches us some valuable lessons:

1. **Precomputation Power**: By precomputing supporter data, we avoid redundant calculations.
2. **Divide and Conquer**: Breaking the problem into frontline and support roles simplifies our strategy.
3. **Time Complexity**: We've reduced the time complexity from O(N^2) to O(N), a legendary improvement!
4. **Space-Time Tradeoff**: We use a bit more memory to store precomputed data, but the speed boost is worth it.

## Battle Variations: Tactical Challenges 🔮

Now that you've mastered the basic battle plan, consider these mystical variations:

1. What if warriors had special abilities that activated when paired with certain allies?
2. How would you modify the strategy if the boss had a weakness that some warriors could exploit?
3. Can you adapt the algorithm for a battle royale where multiple bosses and warrior teams fight simultaneously?

## Your Turn to Command the Battle! ✨

Ready to prove yourself as the ultimate battle tactician? Here are some challenges:

1. Can you modify the algorithm to also return the total survival time of our warrior duo?
2. How would you adapt this for a three-warrior team instead of just two?
3. Can you create a visualization of the battle, showing damage dealt over time?

Remember, young strategist, in the realm of algorithmic battles, efficiency and cleverness are the true measures of a legendary tactician. May your strategies always be swift and your algorithms ever victorious! 🏆💻✨
