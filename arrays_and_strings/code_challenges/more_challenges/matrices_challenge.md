# Matrix Mastery: Cross-Cutting Coding Challenges 🧩🔢🏆

Greetings, matrix manipulators and code conjurers! It's time to put your skills to the test with a series of mind-bending, reality-warping matrix challenges. Each challenge is designed to stretch your understanding of matrices and their applications across different domains. Are you ready to prove your mastery? Let's dive in! 🏊‍♂️💻

## Challenge 1: The Image Encryption Enigma 🖼️🔐

### Scenario:
You're a secret agent tasked with creating an image encryption system using matrix operations.

### Task:
1. Create a function that takes an image (represented as a 2D matrix of pixel values) and an encryption key (another matrix).
2. Encrypt the image by performing matrix multiplication between the image and the key.
3. Create a decryption function that can recover the original image given the encrypted image and the key.

### Bonus:
Implement error handling for cases where the matrices are not compatible for multiplication.

```python
import numpy as np
from PIL import Image

def encrypt_image(image_matrix, key_matrix):
    # Your code here
    pass

def decrypt_image(encrypted_matrix, key_matrix):
    # Your code here
    pass

# Test your functions
image = np.array(Image.open('secret_image.png').convert('L'))
key = np.random.rand(image.shape[1], image.shape[1])

encrypted = encrypt_image(image, key)
decrypted = decrypt_image(encrypted, key)

# Visualize results
Image.fromarray(encrypted.astype('uint8')).save('encrypted_image.png')
Image.fromarray(decrypted.astype('uint8')).save('decrypted_image.png')
```

## Challenge 2: The Quantum Circuit Simulator 🔬🔮

### Scenario:
You're a quantum computing researcher developing a simple quantum circuit simulator using matrix operations.

### Task:
1. Implement basic quantum gates (Hadamard, CNOT, Pauli-X, Pauli-Y, Pauli-Z) as matrices.
2. Create a function that takes a list of gates and applies them to a quantum state vector.
3. Implement a measurement function that collapses the state vector and returns a classical bit string.

### Bonus:
Add support for custom gates defined by arbitrary unitary matrices.

```python
import numpy as np

# Define quantum gates
H = np.array([[1, 1], [1, -1]]) / np.sqrt(2)  # Hadamard gate
X = np.array([[0, 1], [1, 0]])  # Pauli-X gate
# Define other gates...

def apply_circuit(initial_state, gates):
    # Your code here
    pass

def measure(state_vector):
    # Your code here
    pass

# Test your quantum circuit simulator
initial_state = np.array([1, 0])  # |0⟩ state
circuit = [H, X]  # Apply Hadamard then Pauli-X

final_state = apply_circuit(initial_state, circuit)
measurement = measure(final_state)
print(f"Measurement outcome: {measurement}")
```

## Challenge 3: The Social Network Analyzer 🕸️📊

### Scenario:
You're a data scientist analyzing a social network using adjacency matrices and matrix operations.

### Task:
1. Implement a function to create an adjacency matrix from a list of connections.
2. Create functions to find:
   - The number of 2-step connections between users (friends of friends)
   - The most influential user (highest eigenvector centrality)
   - Communities in the network using spectral clustering

### Bonus:
Implement a visualization of the network and its communities.

```python
import numpy as np
import networkx as nx
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt

def create_adjacency_matrix(connections, num_users):
    # Your code here
    pass

def find_two_step_connections(adj_matrix):
    # Your code here
    pass

def find_most_influential(adj_matrix):
    # Your code here
    pass

def find_communities(adj_matrix, num_communities):
    # Your code here
    pass

# Test your social network analyzer
connections = [(0, 1), (0, 2), (1, 2), (2, 3), (3, 4), (4, 5), (5, 3)]
num_users = 6

adj_matrix = create_adjacency_matrix(connections, num_users)
two_step = find_two_step_connections(adj_matrix)
influential = find_most_influential(adj_matrix)
communities = find_communities(adj_matrix, 2)

print(f"Two-step connections:\n{two_step}")
print(f"Most influential user: {influential}")
print(f"Communities:\n{communities}")
```

## Challenge 4: The 3D Graphics Engine 🎮🌈

### Scenario:
You're a game developer creating a basic 3D graphics engine using matrix transformations.

### Task:
1. Implement functions for basic 3D transformations (translation, rotation, scaling) as 4x4 matrices.
2. Create a function that combines multiple transformations into a single matrix.
3. Implement a simple renderer that projects 3D points onto a 2D plane using matrix operations.

### Bonus:
Add support for camera transformations and perspective projection.

```python
import numpy as np
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt

def translate(tx, ty, tz):
    # Your code here
    pass

def rotate(angle, axis):
    # Your code here
    pass

def scale(sx, sy, sz):
    # Your code here
    pass

def combine_transformations(transformations):
    # Your code here
    pass

def project_3d_to_2d(points_3d, transformation_matrix):
    # Your code here
    pass

# Test your 3D graphics engine
cube_points = np.array([
    [0, 0, 0], [1, 0, 0], [1, 1, 0], [0, 1, 0],
    [0, 0, 1], [1, 0, 1], [1, 1, 1], [0, 1, 1]
])

transformations = [
    translate(0.5, 0.5, 0),
    rotate(np.pi/4, 'y'),
    scale(1.5, 1.5, 1.5)
]

combined_transform = combine_transformations(transformations)
projected_points = project_3d_to_2d(cube_points, combined_transform)

## Words of Wisdom from the Matrix Grandmaster 🧙‍♂️

"Remember, young matrix mavens, these challenges are not just about manipulating numbers in grids. They're about seeing the underlying patterns in complex systems, from quantum realms to social networks, from visual data to artificial minds. Master these, and you'll have the power to model and transform reality itself through the lens of mathematics and computation!"
