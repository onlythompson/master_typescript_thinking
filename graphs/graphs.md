# The Social Network of Everythingville: Unraveling the Graph Mystery! 🌐🧩

Greetings, social scientists and connection detectives! Today, we're diving into the fascinating world of Graphs - the ultimate social network where everything and everyone can be connected. Grab your friendship bracelets as we map out the intricate web of relationships in Everythingville! 🕵️‍♂️🤝

## The Residents of Everythingville: Our Graph Components 🏘️

Imagine a town where every resident (node) knows certain other residents (edges), creating a complex web of relationships!

### Key Citizens of Our Social Network:

1. **Nodes (Vertices):** The residents of Everythingville.
2. **Edges:** The friendships or connections between residents.
3. **Neighborhoods:** Groups of closely connected residents.

```python
class Resident:
    def __init__(self, name):
        self.name = name
        self.friends = []

class Everythingville:
    def __init__(self):
        self.residents = {}
```

## Building Our Social Network 🤼‍♂️

### 1. Welcoming New Residents (Adding Nodes)

When someone new moves to town:

```python
def add_resident(self, name):
    if name not in self.residents:
        self.residents[name] = Resident(name)
```

### 2. Forming Friendships (Adding Edges)

When two residents become friends:

```python
def make_friends(self, name1, name2):
    if name1 in self.residents and name2 in self.residents:
        self.residents[name1].friends.append(name2)
        self.residents[name2].friends.append(name1)
```

### 3. Finding Friends of Friends (Traversal)

Exploring the social circles:

```python
def find_friends_of_friends(self, name, max_depth=2):
    visited = set()
    def dfs(current, depth):
        if depth > max_depth:
            return
        visited.add(current)
        for friend in self.residents[current].friends:
            if friend not in visited:
                print(f"{friend} is a depth-{depth} connection of {name}")
                dfs(friend, depth + 1)
    
    dfs(name, 1)
```

## The Two Faces of Friendship: Directed vs Undirected Graphs 🎭

In Everythingville, some connections are mutual, while others are one-sided!

```python
class DirectedEverythingville(Everythingville):
    def make_friends(self, name1, name2):
        if name1 in self.residents and name2 in self.residents:
            self.residents[name1].friends.append(name2)
            # Note: name2 doesn't automatically become friends with name1
```

## The Weight of Relationships: Weighted Graphs ⚖️

Not all friendships are equal! Some residents are closer than others:

```python
def make_close_friends(self, name1, name2, closeness):
    if name1 in self.residents and name2 in self.residents:
        self.residents[name1].friends.append((name2, closeness))
        self.residents[name2].friends.append((name1, closeness))
```

## Curiosity Corner: Six Degrees of Separation 🤔🌐

Have you heard that everyone in the world is connected by just six (or fewer) social connections? This famous theory is a perfect example of graph concepts in action!

```python
def degrees_of_separation(self, start, end):
    visited = set()
    queue = [(start, 0)]
    while queue:
        current, degree = queue.pop(0)
        if current == end:
            return degree
        if current not in visited:
            visited.add(current)
            for friend in self.residents[current].friends:
                queue.append((friend, degree + 1))
    return "Not connected!"
```
