# Fenwick Tree: The Smart Sum Calculator 🧮

Imagine you have a list of numbers, and you frequently need to:
1. Update a single number in the list
2. Calculate the sum of numbers from the start of the list up to any point

A Fenwick Tree helps you do both these operations quickly and efficiently.

## How It Works 🔍

Think of the Fenwick Tree as a clever way to store partial sums of your list.

1. **The Basic Idea:**
   - We store the original list, plus some extra "sum" entries.
   - These extra entries help us quickly calculate sums without adding up every number each time.

2. **The Structure:**
   - We use an array to represent our Fenwick Tree.
   - Each index in this array is responsible for a certain range of the original list.

3. **The Magic of Binary:**
   - We use binary properties of indices to determine which ranges each index covers.
   - This is why it's also called a "Binary Indexed Tree".

## Key Operations 🛠️

### 1. Updating a Value

When you update a value in your original list:
- You also update all the partial sums that include this value.
- You do this by following a specific path up the tree.

```python
def update(index, value):
    while index <= n:  # n is the size of the list
        tree[index] += value
        index += index & (-index)  # This is the binary magic!
```

### 2. Calculating Prefix Sum

To find the sum from the start to any point:
- You combine several partial sums stored in the tree.
- You do this by following a specific path down the tree.

```python
def get_sum(index):
    total = 0
    while index > 0:
        total += tree[index]
        index -= index & (-index)  # More binary magic!
    return total
```

## Why It's Cool 😎

1. **Speed:** Both update and sum operations take O(log n) time, which is very fast!
2. **Space Efficient:** It uses only a little more space than your original list.
3. **Versatile:** It can be used for other operations too, not just sums.

## Real-World Use 🌍

- Calculating cumulative scores in games
- Managing financial data in spreadsheets
- Analyzing trends in data science

## Simple Example 📊

Let's say you have this list of numbers: [3, 2, 1, 4]

Your Fenwick Tree array might look like this:
```
Index:  0   1   2   3   4
Value:  0   3   5   1   10
        |   |   |   |   |
        |   3   |   1   |
        |   |   5   |   |
        |   |   |   |   10
```

- Tree[1] = 3 (sum of first 1 element)
- Tree[2] = 5 (sum of first 2 elements)
- Tree[3] = 1 (just the 3rd element)
- Tree[4] = 10 (sum of all 4 elements)

To get the sum of the first 3 numbers, you'd do:
```
get_sum(3) = Tree[3] + Tree[2] = 1 + 5 = 6
```

Remember, the Fenwick Tree is all about clever storage of partial sums to make calculations faster. It's like having a cheat sheet for quick addition!

# The Magical Cumulative Coin Counter of Pixelville! 💰🏙️✨

Greetings, digital bankers and binary money mages! Today, we're diving into the wondrous world of Pixelville, where every citizen's wealth is tracked by a revolutionary system - the Fenwick Tree, also known as the Binary Indexed Tree. Get ready to count coins faster than you can say "cryptocurrency"! 🧙‍♂️🪙

## The Pixelated Coin Towers of Pixelville 🏦

Imagine a city where each citizen's wealth is represented by a stack of pixelated coins. But here's the magical twist - certain special towers can tell you the total wealth of entire neighborhoods in an instant!

### Key Components of Our Magical Money System:

1. **Coin Stacks:** Individual citizen's wealth (array elements).
2. **Magic Towers:** Special structures that sum up wealth for specific ranges.
3. **Binary Magic:** The secret sauce that makes our system lightning-fast!

```python
class PixelvilleTreasury:
    def __init__(self, initial_wealth):
        self.citizen_count = len(initial_wealth)
        self.coin_towers = [0] * (self.citizen_count + 1)
        for i, coins in enumerate(initial_wealth, 1):
            self.update(i, coins)

    def update(self, citizen_index, coin_change):
        while citizen_index <= self.citizen_count:
            self.coin_towers[citizen_index] += coin_change
            citizen_index += citizen_index & (-citizen_index)

    def get_sum(self, citizen_index):
        total_coins = 0
        while citizen_index > 0:
            total_coins += self.coin_towers[citizen_index]
            citizen_index -= citizen_index & (-citizen_index)
        return total_coins
```

## Managing Pixelville's Economy 🎮

### 1. Citizen Gets Richer (or Poorer) - Point Update

When a citizen's wealth changes:

```python
def change_citizen_wealth(self, citizen_index, coin_change):
    self.update(citizen_index, coin_change)
```

### 2. Calculating Neighborhood Wealth - Range Query

To find the total wealth from citizen 1 to X:

```python
def get_neighborhood_wealth(self, last_citizen):
    return self.get_sum(last_citizen)

# To get wealth between citizens a and b:
def get_wealth_range(self, a, b):
    return self.get_sum(b) - self.get_sum(a - 1)
```

## The Magic of Binary in Our Coin Towers 🔮

The real wizardry lies in how we use binary properties:

1. **Magical Leaps:** We use `index & (-index)` to find the next tower to update or query.
2. **Binary Breakdown:** Each tower holds the sum for a specific power-of-two range.

Visualize it like this:
```
Index:  1   2   3   4   5   6   7   8
Range:  1   2   1   4   1   2   1   8
        |   |___|   |_______|   |_____________________
        |       |           |                       |
        1       2           4                       8
```

## The Mayor's Secret Spell: 2D Fenwick Trees 🔲

For managing wealth across both citizens and time:

```python
class PixelvilleTimeTreasury:
    def __init__(self, rows, cols):
        self.rows, self.cols = rows, cols
        self.matrix = [[0] * (cols + 1) for _ in range(rows + 1)]

    def update(self, row, col, value):
        i, j = row, col
        while i <= self.rows:
            while j <= self.cols:
                self.matrix[i][j] += value
                j += j & (-j)
            i += i & (-i)
            j = col

    def get_sum(self, row, col):
        total = 0
        i, j = row, col
        while i > 0:
            while j > 0:
                total += self.matrix[i][j]
                j -= j & (-j)
            i -= i & (-i)
            j = col
        return total
```

This spell allows us to track wealth changes over time and across citizen groups!
