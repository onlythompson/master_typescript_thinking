# Bit Vectors: The Digital Locker Room üéíüî¢

Imagine you're managing a small gym's locker room. There are 32 lockers, and you need to keep track of which ones are occupied or free. This is where Bit Vectors come in handy!

## What is a Bit Vector?

A Bit Vector is like a row of switches, where each switch represents a yes/no (or on/off) state. In our gym example:
- Each locker is a switch
- 'On' (1) means the locker is occupied
- 'Off' (0) means the locker is free

## How Does It Work?

We use a single 32-bit integer to represent all 32 lockers. Each bit in this integer corresponds to one locker.

```python
class LockerRoom:
    def __init__(self):
        self.lockers = 0  # All lockers start free (0)
```

## Basic Operations

1. **Occupy a Locker (Turn a bit on)**
   ```python
   def occupy_locker(self, locker_number):
       self.lockers |= (1 << locker_number)
   ```
   This is like flipping the switch for a specific locker to 'occupied'.

2. **Free a Locker (Turn a bit off)**
   ```python
   def free_locker(self, locker_number):
       self.lockers &= ~(1 << locker_number)
   ```
   This is like flipping the switch for a specific locker back to 'free'.

3. **Check if a Locker is Occupied**
   ```python
   def is_occupied(self, locker_number):
       return bool(self.lockers & (1 << locker_number))
   ```
   This checks the state of a specific locker's switch.

4. **Count Occupied Lockers**
   ```python
   def count_occupied(self):
       return bin(self.lockers).count('1')
   ```
   This counts how many switches are in the 'on' position.

## Why Use Bit Vectors?

1. **Space Efficient**: One integer can represent 32 lockers.
2. **Fast Operations**: Checking or changing locker states is very quick.
3. **Easy Group Operations**: You can easily perform actions on multiple lockers at once.

## Real-World Uses

- **Computer Science**: Managing memory allocation, data compression
- **Databases**: Fast set operations, indexing
- **Networks**: IP address allocation, network masks
- **Graphics**: Image processing, screen buffer management

## Simple Example

```python
gym = LockerRoom()
gym.occupy_locker(5)  # Someone uses locker 5
gym.occupy_locker(10)  # Another person uses locker 10
print(gym.is_occupied(5))  # True
print(gym.is_occupied(6))  # False
print(gym.count_occupied())  # 2
gym.free_locker(5)  # Person leaves, locker 5 is now free
```

In this simple gym scenario, we can efficiently manage 32 lockers using just one integer, performing quick operations to occupy, free, and check lockers.

Remember, Bit Vectors are all about using individual bits to represent simple yes/no states for many items, allowing for efficient storage and fast operations on those states.

    bit_position = device_id % 32
    if status:
        self.bit_vector[vector_index] |= (1 << bit_position)
    else:
        self.bit_vector[vector_index] &= ~(1 << bit_position)

def get_device_status(self, device_id):
    vector_index = device_id // 32
    bit_position = device_id % 32
    return bool(self.bit_vector[vector_index] & (1 << bit_position))
